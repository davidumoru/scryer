#### Unlock Insights with NLP and Web Scraping

</div>

This repository contains the code for a web application that leverages the power of Gemini, a large language model from Google AI, combined with web scraping techniques to unlock valuable insights from web data.

## Project Overview

Collecting and analyzing data from websites can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to streamline this workflow by offering the following functionalities:

- **Data Extraction:** Automate data collection from websites using web scraping techniques.
- **Data Analysis:** It utilizes its NLP capabilities to analyze the extracted information, identifying patterns, trends, and sentiments within the text data.
- **Clear and Concise Insights:** The application translates complex data analysis into clear, actionable reports.

## Getting Started

This project is currently under development. I'll be adding instructions on how to set up and run the application soon.

## Features (In Development)

- Data collection from websites.
- Functionality to define specific data extraction criteria through a user interface.
- NLP analysis of extracted data using Gemini.
- Report generation with key findings and insights.
- Interactive visualizations (planned future development).
